You are the joy, the youthful presence in our University in full development. You come with the desire to know, to learn and to receive a university education. You come to interact with a new and quite unknown world for you. You come to live with a community made up of professors, workers, university authorities and other students who have already advanced in their studies. You will interact with all of them and you will have to do it in the greatest harmony, in a human environment that induces tranquility and the spiritual development that study requires. Give love and care to your University, protect it, keep it full and beautiful for the new generations of Unimar students. UNIMAR receives you in its lap with great joy. Welcome',
